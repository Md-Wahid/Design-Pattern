# Design-Pattern

Design patterns are used to represent some of the best practices adapted by experienced object-oriented software developers. A design pattern systematically names, motivates, and explains a general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object-oriented systems. It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences. It also gives implementation hints and examples.

Some commonly used design patterns are,
1. Singleton Design Pattern,
2. Strategy Pattern,
3. CQRS Pattern,
4. Mediator Design Pattern, etc.

### 1. Singleton Design Pattern

1. The singleton pattern is one of the most known and easiest design patterns in software engineering. In simple words, a singleton is a class which only allows a single instance of itself to be created. There are various different ways to implement this pattern in C#. In this tutorial, I will show you how you can implement the singleton design pattern with minimum amount of code.
2. According to our Console application shows how to use a singleton _SingletonClass_ class. The first object _singletonClass1_ is created properly while attempt to create second instance _singletonClass2_ will return null.
